### Presentation Language

This specification deals with the serialization and representation of data in external contexts. To help describe the format of the data a high-level programming syntax will be used. These formats are intended to represent data as it would be structured for transmission, i.e., on the wire format, and not necessarily that of how the data would be stored in memory. The syntax used resembles the "C" programming language, however its purpose is to be illustrative and not language accurate.

#### Comments

Code comments in this specification begin with `//` and continue to the end of the line. Optionally comments can be represented as beginning with `/*` and ending with `*/`.

#### Array Types

Any types of data that exist in a series are represented with brackets, i.e., `data[]`, and called arrays. Arrays are defined as a pointer to a block of memory representing the series of data types. Since the array is a pointer, it will be assumed to be pointing to nothing when its value is `null`. An array declared with empty brackets indicates an array of variable size. An array that represents a specific number of elements will be declared with an integer count within the brackets, e.g., `data[2]`. An array with zero elements is considered an empty array.

#### Numeric Types

Representation of all data types is explicitly specified. The most fundamental unit of data is one byte, i.e., 8-bits. The basic numeric data type is an unsigned byte, called a `uint8`, which represents integers between 0 and 255. All larger numeric data types are multi-byte values encoded as a contiguous sequence of bytes. The following numeric types are predefined:

```C
  uint8[2] int16;  // Represents integers between -32768 and 32767
  uint8[3] int24;  // Represents integers between -8,388,608 and 8,388,607
  uint8[4] int32;  // Represents integers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647
  uint8[8] int64;  // Represents integers between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  uint8[2] uint16; // Represents integers between 0 and 65,535
  uint8[3] uint24; // Represents integers between 0 and 16,777,215
  uint8[4] uint32; // Represents integers between 0 and 4,294,967,295
  uint8[8] uint64; // Represents integers between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
  uint8[16] guid;  // Represents a 128-bit globally unique identifier
```

#### Enumerated Types

To represent an enumerated set of possible values, a numeric type is defined called an `enum`. Normally an enumerated type only represents its defined values, however, when the enumerated type values represent bit values, or flags, the enumerated type can represent any number of its possible values at once. Every element of an enumerated type must be assigned a value, as a result values can be defined in any order. Importantly, an enumerated type will only occupy space needed for its maximum defined value when serialized. For example, the following enumerated type would only require one byte:

```C
  enum {
    Red = 0,
    Green = 1,
    Blue = 2
  }
  Color;
```

Unless otherwise specified, all enumerated types are considered unsigned.

#### Standard Endianness

When multi-byte data items are encoded as a sequence of contiguous bytes, they are shown from left to right when described horizontally or from top to bottom when described vertically. Unless otherwise specified, byte-ordering for encoded multi-byte values will always be in big-endian order, i.e., common network byte order.

When extracted from a stream of bytes on a system whose native byte-ordering is little-endian, a multi-byte item, e.g., a 32-bit integer value, could be decoded as follows:

```C
  uint32 value = buffer[0] << 24 | buffer[1] << 16 | buffer[2] << 8 | buffer[3];
```

#### Common Structures

The following common code structures are predefined for use within other STTP protocol structures.

##### Version Structure

Represents a versioned entity, e.g., a protocol version, consisting of a byte for the major and minor components of the version:

```C
struct {
  uint8 major;
  uint8 minor;
}
Version;
```
- The `major` field defines the major component of the represented version.
- The `minor` field defines the minor component of the represented version.

##### NamedVersion Structure

Represents a named entity and associated version, e.g., a compression algorithm, consisting of a [`Version`](#version-structure) and an ASCII encoded string name.

```C
struct {
  uint8[20] name;
  Version version;
}
NamedVersion;
```
- The `name` field defines an ASCII encoded string name for this structure. Field name should be padded with spaces to the right and any serializations should not include a null terminator, i.e., a zero value character.
- The `version` field defines a [`Version`](#version-structure) number for this structure.

> :information_source: Small fixed string size for `name` field expected to be sufficient for foreseeable use cases, e.g., specification of compression algorithm.

##### NamedVersions Structure

Represents a collection of [`NamedVersion`](#namedversion-structure) entities which includes a count of the total elements.

```C
struct {
  uint16 count;
  NamedVersion[] items;
}
NamedVersions;
```
- The `count` field defines the total number of elements in the `items` array.
- The `items` field is an array of [`NamedVersion`](#namedversion-structure) structures.

#### Common Functions

The following common functions are predefined for use within other STTP functions.

##### 15-bit Encoding Functions

The following functions take an unsigned 16-bit integer and apply a 15-bit encoding scheme that will serialize the provided 16-bit unsigned integer as either 1 or 2 bytes, depending on its value:

```C
// Values greater than 32767 will return null
uint8[] Encode15Bits(uint16 value) {
  if (value <= 127)
    return { (uint8)value };
  else if (value <= 32767)
    return { (uint8)((value & 127) + 128), (uint8)(value >> 7) };

  return null;
}

uint16 Decode15Bits(uint8[] data) {
  if (data[0] <= 127)
    return data[0];

  return (uint16)(data[0] - 128) | (uint16)(data[1] << 7);
}
```
