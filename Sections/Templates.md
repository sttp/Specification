## Appendix F - STTP Templates

### Overview
The base STTP protocol can be used for any type of time series data.  However, if every implementation of STTP is unique then sharing metadata in an automated fashion will be unique for each implementation.    In order to assist in standardization of the grouping of data and streamlining the structure of the metadata templates are defined.


A template is a schema that defines how the base metadata will be organized and how the data structure should be sent. Since the STTP was initially designed to support synchrophasor data included below is a conversations about the elements of the PMU template
