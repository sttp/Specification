**Version:** 0.0.29 - July 5, 2017

**Status:** Initial Development

**Abstract:** This specification defines a [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) data transfer protocol that has been optimized for exchanging streaming [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) style data, such as [synchrophasor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor_measurement_unit) data that is used in the electric power industry, over [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP). The protocol supports transferring both real-time and historical time series data at full or down-sampled resolutions. Protocol benefits are realized at scale when multiplexing very large numbers of time series [data points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point) at high speed, such as, hundreds of times per second per data point.
